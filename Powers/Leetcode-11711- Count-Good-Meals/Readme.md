### Approach
Here the problem was to find the two numbers who add up to a power of 2. <BR>
 We can add all numbers and see if it a power of two, but it happens in n<sup>2</sup> complexity. <BR>
  The max number in the array is 2<sup>20</sup> so max sum that can be obtained is 2<sup>20</sup> + 2<sup>20</sup>. <BR>
  So any number when added with another number can only form 21 distinct numbers (that are powers of two). <BR>
  We use this concept to solve the problems.
